# BISB Bootcamp {{ cookiecutter.year }}

Welcome to the {{ cookiecutter.year }} Bootcamp for incoming students to our Bioinformatics & Systems Biology (BISB) doctoral program!

## Goals of the Bootcamp

This 5-day intensive course is designed to place incoming students on a path to success in their doctoral studies. We hope to accomplish this by conducting the following:

* Introduce the BISB doctoral program, the University of California, San Diego, and the greater San Diego area
* Foster community and collaboration among students of the incoming cohort and as well as senior students
* Convey expectations for the core curriculum and key courses, while reviewing basic concepts to remedy deficiencies
* Guide students in preparing for their research rotations and discuss considerations when choosing a thesis advisor
* Review strategies for a successful career in science including fellowships, internships, and scientific communication

## Course Instructors

This course is led by BISB graduate students! There are four main instructors for the course from the Bioinformatics & Systems Biology program. The main instructors teach the majority of "learning modules", along with lectures that contain helpful graduate school knoweldge. There are also quite a few guest instructors that will also be joining the course!
