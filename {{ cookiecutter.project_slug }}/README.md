# BISB Bootcamp {{ cookiecutter.year }}

Welcome to the {{ cookiecutter.year }} Bootcamp for incoming students to the UC San Diego Bioinformatics & Systems Biology (BISB) doctoral program!

This 5-day intensive course is designed to place incoming students on a path to success in their doctoral studies by conducting the following:

* Introduce the doctoral program, the University of California, San Diego, and the greater San Diego area
* Foster community and collaboration among students of the incoming cohort and with senior students
* Convey expectations for the core curriculum and elective courses, while reviewing basic concepts to remedy deficiencies
* Showcase faculty research and guide students in preparing for their research rotations
* Review strategies for choosing a thesis advisor, navigating a PhD, and preparing for a scientific career

Bootcamp's content spans the topics listed above and delivered through lectures, discussions, and interactive modules.

## Learn about BISB/BMI Research: Summer Faculty Talks

Over the summer, prior to Bootcamp, we host a weekly seminar series via Zoom where BISB and BMI faculty share their work and incoming students can tune-in to learn about research opportunities. To learn more about this year's series, visit the [summer-faculty-talks.md](./summer-faculty-talks.md) file.

## Course Instructors

This course is led by current BISB graduate students! Four lead instructors curate Bootcamp's content and give the majority of lectures, while guest instructors are invited to provide instruction on specialized topics.
