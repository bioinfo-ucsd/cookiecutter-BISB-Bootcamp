# BISB Bootcamp {{ cookiecutter.year }}

Welcome to the {{ cookiecutter.year }} Bootcamp for incoming students to the UC San Diego Bioinformatics & Systems Biology (BISB) doctoral program!

This 5-day intensive course is designed to place incoming students on a path to success in their doctoral studies by conducting the following:

* Introduce the doctoral program, the University of California, San Diego, and the greater San Diego area
* Foster community and collaboration among students of the incoming cohort and with senior students
* Convey expectations for the core curriculum and elective courses, while reviewing basic concepts to remedy deficiencies
* Showcase faculty research and guide students in preparing for their research rotations
* Review strategies for choosing a thesis advisor, navigating a PhD, and preparing for a scientific career

Bootcamp's content spans the topics listed above and delivered through lectures, discussions, and interactive modules.

## Questions?

*For questions about bootcamp,* please contact your bootcamp instructors!

*For general questions about student life in the BISB Program,* feel free to message to the BISB Student Discord. You should receive an invite link in our first email. Our discord server is entirely student-run, and you can find people from different labs, different years, and different program tracks! It is a great informal resource to chat with your fellow students, especially as many of us were working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. *Please note that the BISB Student Discord and the BISB Student Website are student-run and student-curated resources. Therefore, please do not share the access link with faculty or staff members.*

*For formal questions about the program and program requirements,* please contact our program coordinator, Fran Perez Estrada! Another helpful resource, especially for financial matters, is Elizabeth Soos, the Student Affairs Manager for our program and the Department of Bioengineering.
